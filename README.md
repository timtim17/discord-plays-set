# Discord Plays Set!

![screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/D8Z7B9f.png)

Small little bot to allow users in a [Discord](https://discord.com) channel to play the game of
[Set!](https://setgame.com) together.

## What is Set?

Set! is a game by [Set Enterprises Inc.](https//setgame.com). A board of cards is laid out, each
with various shapes. Each card has four properties: the fill style (solid, striped, or outline),
shape (oval, squiggle, or diamond), color (red, green, or purple), and count (1, 2, or 3 shapes).
The goal is to make as many Sets as possible - groups of three cards where for each property, the
cards are *either* all unique or all the same.

an assignment used in the University of Washington's [CSE 154: Web Development](https://cs.uw.edu/154).

#### Disclaimer

This is a Discord version of the game of Set, which is also used as a homework assignment in
CSE 154. **This is not a solution for that assignment.** The code for this Discord bot is completely
different from the code that would be needed to complete that assignment. If you are a student looking
for a solution... just uh... do your homework. (⚆_⚆)
